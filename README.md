# Dark Monkey

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) /
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
scripts to bring (extra) dark modes to various websites.

I generally use
[Night Eye](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-mode-night-eye/alncdjedloppbablonallfbkeiknmkdi)
to make most websites dark, but sometimes I want more control
and extra dark backgrounds.

## Scripts

* [Gradescope](Gradescope Dark Mode.user.js):
  Inverted PDF viewer with adjustable brightness
* [MIT WebSIS](WebSIS Dark Mode.user.js)
* [Workflowy](Workflowy Black.user.js) (makes Dark theme extra dark)
